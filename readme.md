- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) (Highly Recommended)

- PDF
- Markdown
- Slides

### Topic

You can choose ***ONE*** from the following topics, or ***propose*** your own:

- Introduction to Python Programming: Functions and Scope of Variables
- Introduction to Python Programming: Object Orientated Programming
- Introduction to Python Programming: [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) Style Guide
- Data Science with Python: Linear Model Regression
- Data Science with Python: Unsupervised Learning
- Data Sciecne with Python: Classification
- Data Science with Python: Reinforcement Learning

### Questions to Expect

You can expect questions in (including but not limited to):

- Common issues with Jupyter Notebook
- Beginner level questions on the topic you teach
- Common issues or mistakes that beginners might run into 
- Advanced level questions on machine learning theory
- Python related questions

### Submission

1. `create` a _GitHub_ repository for your workshop
2. `push` your workshop to the repository
3. `email` the link to your repository before 2 Nov 00:00 London Time to <a>tony.wu.19@ucl.ac.uk</a>

> Use our [working protocol](https://github.com/UCL-DSS/readme) at _Science_ as a guideline

> Learn to use Git and GitHub, our [workshop meterial on Git and Github](https://github.com/UCL-DSS/git-workshop) might be helpful, or use any tutorial you prefer

## A Bit of Help üí°

In order to get you started, we have the following resources prepared for you.

- Use our [working protocol](https://github.com/UCL-DSS/readme) at _Science_ as a guideline
- Take a look at the [workshop materials that we have](https://github.com/UCL-DSS) at the moment, get some ideas from it. Example for a Introduction to Python Programming workshop is [PY02](https://github.com/UCL-DSS/python-sequence-workshop) and for a Data Science with Python workshop is [DS01](https://github.com/UCL-DSS/numpy-workshop)
- Reference to API docs is defintely desirable and recommended, the examples above will show you how to do it
- Think about what kind of activities, exercises, homeworks, contents and so on will be reasonable for a one-hour long workshop. For instance, some thinking problem might be helpful. Take the examples given above as reference
- Use the official tutorial provided by the packages or modules you are introducing as a guideline
- Practice presenting it, teaching it, answering questions
- What if you don‚Äôt know the answer to a question? Demostrate how to find the answer

Contact me if you have any question.
